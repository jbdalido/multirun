```bzl
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl", "git_repository")

# multirun is written in Go and hence needs rules_go to be built.
# See https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_go for the up to date setup instructions.

`BUILD.bazel` file:

```bzl
load("@com_github_jbdalido_multirun//multirun:def.bzl", "multirun", "command")

command(
    name = "command1",
    command = "//some/label",
    arguments = [

    raw_environment = {
        "PATH": "$(pwd)/path",
    },
)

multirun(
    name = "run_all",
    commands = [
        ":command1",
